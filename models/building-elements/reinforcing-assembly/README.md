This example illustrates a beam with an assembly of reinforcing stirrups, the geometry of the stirrups is defined by mapped items linking to a mapped representation being a swept disk solid along a directrix. Figure 518 shows the resulting shape.



> NOTE  The directrix is defined by *IfcIndexedPolyCurve*
