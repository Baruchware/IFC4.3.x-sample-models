The example shows a straight column with a rectangular cross section being tessellated with a mesh. Figure 479 and Figure 480 display the rendering in a target application.


The example shows a tessellation with adding the normals at each vertex to the data set. The list of vertices given by the *IfcCartesianPointList3D* and the list of normals given by the *IfcTriangulatedFaceSet*.Normals are corresponding lists, therefore the *IfcTriangulatedFaceSet*.NormalIndex is not provided and the *IfcTriangulatedFaceSet*.CoordIndex applies to both lists.
