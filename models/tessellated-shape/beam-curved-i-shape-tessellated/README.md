The example shows a curved beam with an I-Shape cross section being tessellated with a fine mesh. Figure 477 and Figure 478 display the rendering in a target application.



> 
> NOTE  The density of the mesh depends on the algorithm used by the application. In general it is recommended to not use an overly fine mesh to minimize data set sizes. The mesh density of the example is already very high.

The example shows a tessellation without adding the normals at each vertex to the data set.
