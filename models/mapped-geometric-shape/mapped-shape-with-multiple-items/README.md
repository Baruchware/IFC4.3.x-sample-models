The mapped representation can be generated by a mapped item placing multiple mapped representation with or without Cartesian transformations.

Figure 488 — Mapped representation with multiple items

The representation map, being a simple block, is inserted four times as a mapped item for the building element proxy within its local 
object coordinate system. Each item is transformed by a rotation by 45' in xy plane and by a non-uniform scaling with 
x-scale=0.5, y-scale=0.5 and z-scale=1.0. The items are translated within the local
object coordinate system to be placed in a grid of 1m x 1m. See Figure 488.
